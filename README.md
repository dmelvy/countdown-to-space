# Project Overview

## Countdown to Space

## Project Description

With this simple app, users will be able to easily see when the next SpaceX launch will take place. They will also be able to see past launches.

## API and Data Sample

I am using the SpaceX API: https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API 
``` "crew": [],
        "ships": [],
        "capsules": [],
        "payloads": [
            "5fbfedc654ceb10a5664c814"
        ],
        "launchpad": "5e9e4502f509094188566f88",
        "auto_update": true,
        "launch_library_id": "dfd4f0e0-0ab4-494d-bd88-1b93b934b269",
        "failures": [],
        "flight_number": 116,
